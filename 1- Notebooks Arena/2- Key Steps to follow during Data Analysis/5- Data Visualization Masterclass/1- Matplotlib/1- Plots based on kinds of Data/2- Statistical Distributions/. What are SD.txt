Statistical Distributions
Statistical distributions represent the frequency or probability of different outcomes or values in a dataset. They provide a summary of how data is spread or distributed across different values, often used to understand the underlying patterns or tendencies in the data.

These are visual representations of how the values of one or more variables are distributed within a dataset. They help in understanding the shape, spread, central tendency, and variability of the data.
